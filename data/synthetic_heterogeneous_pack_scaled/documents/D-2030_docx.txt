**MOTION FOR SUSPENDED PRESENTATION OF DEFENSE – TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL v. CITY OF OAKVILLE**

**To the Honorable Judge [Judge’s Name] of the [Court Name]**

**Case Name:** Technology International, Inc. v. City of Oakville

**Court:** [Specific Court – e.g., Circuit Court of [County]]

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Plaintiff, Technology International, Inc. (“Technology”) respectfully moves this Court for a suspended presentation of the defense to City of Oakville’s inquiry regarding the alleged violation of [Specific Regulation - e.g., Section 4.2 of the Data Privacy Act] related to the processing of user data within the city’s digital infrastructure.  We firmly believe that a complete and expedited resolution of this matter is essential to minimize further disruption to Technology’s operations and protect its client’s interests.  The City’s inquiries, while concerning, are presently unduly delaying the provision of necessary information and hindering the efficient implementation of Technology’s proposed data mitigation strategy, which involves a significant investment of resources and time. 

The City’s inquiry centers primarily on the potential impact of Technology’s data handling practices on the city’s citizens, specifically regarding the collection and retention of data from mobile devices within designated zones.  While we acknowledge the need for regulatory oversight, the current scope of the inquiry appears to be overly broad and lacks sufficient context to adequately assess the potential risks to Technology. Specifically, the inquiries lack a clear understanding of the specific technological capabilities employed and the tangible impact on the citizens the City is seeking to address.  We have meticulously reviewed the City’s initial documentation and have identified significant gaps in the foundational understanding necessary for a meaningful and productive dialogue.  We are confident that a more targeted and preliminary assessment would be far more effective in allowing Technology to prepare a robust and compliant response. 

Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court suspend the formal presentation of the defense until a more focused investigation is completed. We propose a timeline for the City to convene a meeting with Technology's legal counsel and representatives of the affected citizens to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the regulatory landscape and potential mitigation strategies.  This suspended presentation allows us to actively engage with the City, address their concerns, and demonstrate our commitment to compliance without being unduly burdened by the current demands of this inquiry. We anticipate a swift and positive resolution to this matter, and believe that suspending the presentation of the defense is the most prudent course of action for both parties.

Respectfully submitted,
