**Legal Brief – Manufacturing Group LLC v. ACME Corp – Employment Dispute**

**To:** Honorable Judge [Judge’s Name]
**From:** [Your Name/Law Firm Name]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Re:** Request for Summary Judgment – Dispute over Promised Bonus

This brief addresses the employment dispute between Manufacturing Group LLC (“Manufacturing Group”) and ACME Corp (“ACME”), concerning the payment of a promised bonus awarded in a prior performance review.  Manufacturing Group alleges that ACME breached a written employment agreement by failing to fulfill its obligation to award the promised bonus as stipulated in Section 4.2 of the agreement dated [Date of Agreement].  Specifically, ACME’s recent refusal to release the bonus, despite documented performance deficiencies and a documented agreement to revisit the bonus upon satisfactory performance improvements, constitutes a material breach of contract and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as understood within the context of similar agreements.  We are requesting immediate summary judgment in our favor because the evidence clearly demonstrates that ACME’s actions demonstrate a clear disregard for its contractual obligations and a substantial alteration of the terms of the agreement.

The foundational basis for this dispute rests upon the explicit promise contained within the written employment agreement. Section 4.2 of this agreement stipulates a bonus payment of $10,000 to be awarded upon successful completion of a performance improvement plan.  Manufacturing Group has presented extensive documentation demonstrating ACME’s failure to consistently meet the requirements outlined in the agreed-upon improvement plan, despite repeated warnings and opportunities for remediation. Furthermore, ACME’s subsequent denial of the promised bonus directly contradicts the terms of the agreement and undermines the validity of its purported justification for this action.  We contend that ACME’s actions represent a significant deviation from the agreed-upon terms and significantly diminish the value of any potential future employment relationship.

Therefore, we respectfully request that the court grant summary judgment in favor of Manufacturing Group LLC. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the argument that ACME has demonstrably failed to fulfill its contractual obligations and acts in a manner inconsistent with the spirit and intent of the employment agreement.  Maintaining the existing terms of the agreement, which incentivizes performance improvements, is crucial for both parties.  We believe that a ruling in favor of Manufacturing Group will protect the company’s investment and uphold the integrity of the agreement.  We are prepared to provide further evidence and will diligently await the court's decision.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm Name]
