**MOTION FOR MOTION – GRANTING REQUEST FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

To the Honorable Judge [Judge’s Name] of the [Court Name],

This Motion for Determination of the Case’s Status – Granting Request for Dispute Resolution – is hereby filed by Retail Systems (“Client”) in support of a Request for Dispute Resolution (DR) arising from the employment dispute between Client and ACME Corp (“Respondent”). This dispute centers around allegations of discriminatory treatment, specifically regarding [briefly state the alleged issue – e.g., the client’s placement within a lower-level role due to a perceived bias]. The core of the dispute concerns the Client’s claims of wrongful termination and unfair discharge, predicated on a misinterpretation of [mention specific policy or practice cited by Client]. We respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion for Determination of the Case’s Status, allowing for a neutral, mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute without the need for protracted litigation.  We believe that initiating a DR process will more efficiently resolve the matter, minimizing legal costs, and preserving the integrity of both parties’ reputations.

Our client has diligently presented evidence and testimony demonstrating a pattern of unfair treatment, including [specifically list 1-2 key pieces of evidence – e.g., witness statements, documentation of discriminatory practices, performance reviews suggesting bias].  Furthermore, we have provided comprehensive documentation outlining the client’s documented attempts to address the concerns raised and the negative impact these concerns have had on the client's professional development. We also acknowledge and intend to comply fully with any mediation or other proposed dispute resolution processes outlined in the DR agreement.  We are confident that, through a cooperative and transparent approach, a resolution that aligns with fair employment practices will be reached.

The potential costs associated with protracted litigation, including expert witness fees, extensive discovery, and court costs, are substantial and potentially detrimental to both parties.  The DR process offers a significantly more cost-effective alternative, allowing for a faster and more amicable resolution of this complex employment issue. We are prepared to vigorously cooperate with the court’s efforts in facilitating a successful and mutually beneficial outcome for all parties involved. We further request the Court’s authorization to engage in mediation proceedings as a component of this DR process to encourage further progress toward a resolution.

Therefore, we respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion for Determination of the Case’s Status, allowing for a rapid and cost-effective dispute resolution process.  We are available to answer any questions and provide further details regarding the evidence and position presented by Client.

Respectfully submitted,
