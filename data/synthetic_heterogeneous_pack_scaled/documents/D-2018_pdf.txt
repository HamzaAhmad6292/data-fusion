**Subject: Notification of Potential Contract Breach – Aerospace Systems & Contract Agreement Dated [Date of Contract Agreement]**

Dear Mr. Miller,

This firm represents Aerospace Systems (“Client”) in relation to a matter of significant concern: a potential breach of contract arising from the aforementioned agreement dated [Date of Contract Agreement] concerning the provision of specialized structural components for the [Specific Project Name] project.  We have received formal notification from your team detailing discrepancies in the agreed-upon delivery schedule and the associated cost adjustments, which represent a demonstrable failure to adhere to the contractual terms outlined in Section 3.2 of the Agreement. Specifically, the documented timeline for component delivery has been extended by [Number] weeks, increasing the overall cost by approximately [Percentage or Dollar Amount] without a corresponding adjustment to the agreed-upon pricing structure as stipulated in Paragraph 5 of the Agreement.

We understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes lead to delays, and we appreciate your transparency in outlining these issues. However, the current trajectory is creating a significant risk to the successful completion of the [Specific Project Name] project and the associated financial stability of Aerospace Systems.  Based on our initial review of the agreement and the evidence presented, we believe a formal breach of contract has occurred, requiring immediate attention to mitigate potential legal and financial ramifications.  Specifically, we demand that you immediately rectify the timeline discrepancies and re-negotiate the adjusted price to reflect the original agreed-upon terms.

We are currently evaluating our legal options to protect Aerospace Systems’ interests.  We request a meeting within [Number] days to discuss this matter further and explore potential remedies, which may include, but are not limited to, a request for partial reimbursement for the overage costs and a re-evaluation of the project timeline.  Please contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address] to schedule this meeting.  We look forward to your prompt response and a resolution to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Law Firm]
