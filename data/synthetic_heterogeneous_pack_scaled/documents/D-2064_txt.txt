Dear Mr. Miller,

This correspondence serves as a formal notification that Manufacturing Solutions Inc. is asserting a breach of contract following the execution of the agreement dated [Date of Contract] concerning the development of a new widget line. Specifically, we have discovered that Manufacturing Solutions Inc. has failed to deliver on the agreed-upon milestones outlined in Section 3 of the contract, namely the completion of Prototype X and the provision of the necessary specifications for Testing Phase Alpha.  We have retained copies of the contract and related documentation, which are available for your review.

As per the terms of the agreement, Section 4 stipulates a timeline for these milestones, demanding delivery by [Original Due Date].  To date, we have not received these deliverables, and our internal assessments indicate that these delays are significantly impacting our project schedule and associated financial projections. We have previously attempted to address these concerns through [Briefly state previous attempts - e.g., scheduled meetings, emails], but have not been successful in achieving a resolution.  We require a detailed accounting of the time and resources expended to date, as well as a concrete plan to rectify this breach and restore the agreement to its original intent.

Accordingly, we demand immediate action to rectify this situation.  We are requesting a written response outlining your proposed corrective actions, including a revised timeline for the completion of the milestones and a commitment to full payment for the work already completed, in accordance with the agreed-upon payment schedule detailed in Section 5 of the contract.  Failure to respond within [Number] business days (by [Date]) will leave us with no alternative but to pursue legal remedies, including but not limited to seeking monetary damages for breach of contract, lost profits, and reasonable attorney’s fees. We are open to discussing a resolution through amicable negotiation, but expect a formal response to this letter.

Sincerely,
