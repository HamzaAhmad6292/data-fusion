**RE: Formal Notice of Breach of Contract – Finance International v. Sterling Investments**

Dear Mr./Ms. [Recipient Name],

This correspondence serves as a formal notification of a breach of contract by Finance International (“Client”) and Sterling Investments (“Recipient”) concerning the Agreement dated [Date of Agreement], dated [Briefly describe the Agreement - e.g., relating to the provision of financial services].  Specifically, Client has failed to consistently meet the agreed-upon payment schedule outlined within the contract, resulting in a delay of [Number] days in the disbursement of funds.  This breach constitutes a material violation of the terms and conditions stipulated in the aforementioned agreement, which mandates timely payment and adherence to stipulated milestones.  We have documented the outstanding balance of [Amount] as of this date, representing a significant deviation from the agreed-upon payment terms.

We have previously communicated with the Recipient regarding this matter on [Date(s) of Previous Communications] via [Method of Communication - e.g., email, phone call], and these attempts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful.  The current situation raises serious concerns regarding the continuation of the agreed-upon terms and the overall integrity of the financial arrangement.  We believe that a prompt and formal action is required to mitigate further potential losses and ensure compliance with the contract’s provisions.  Specifically, Client requests immediate verification of the outstanding balance and a concrete plan of action to rectify the payment delay.

As a result of this breach, Client is demanding immediate cessation of all further obligations under the Contract.  Should the Recipient fail to acknowledge receipt of this notice and demonstrate a genuine and effective plan to rectify the situation within [Number] days (by [Date]), we are prepared to explore all available legal remedies, including, but not limited to, initiation of litigation to recover the outstanding balance and enforce the remaining obligations under the Agreement.  We are committed to a fair and amicable resolution, but will vigorously protect Client’s rights and interests.  We anticipate scheduling a meeting to discuss this matter further at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
