**Contract for Breach of Contract – Banking International & Client**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Between:** Banking International (hereinafter “Bank”), and [Client Name], hereinafter referred to as “Client” (hereinafter “Client”)

This document constitutes a formal Contract for Breach of Contract, entered into as of this date, and effective immediately.  This agreement follows a period of unsatisfactory performance by the Bank regarding the provision of services outlined in the original Agreement dated [Date of Original Agreement]. Specifically, the Client has repeatedly failed to remit payments as stipulated in Section 3.1 of the Agreement, resulting in a cumulative delay of [Number] days.  The Bank's failure to maintain accurate records of these payments constitutes a material breach of the contract, creating a significant risk to the Client’s financial stability and business operations.  The Bank’s breach is demonstrably causing Client significant hardship and uncertainty.

Under the terms of the Agreement, Section 4 outlines the payment schedule and associated penalties for late payments. The Bank has breached this schedule by failing to issue payment invoices within the stipulated timeframe.  The Bank’s current outstanding balance is currently [Dollar Amount], representing a direct financial loss to the Client. Bank acknowledges that it is committed to resolving this matter amicably and proactively, but further delay in fulfilling its obligations will be considered a material breach. The Bank is prepared to initiate legal action, including potential mediation and/or litigation, to recover all outstanding dues, including accrued interest and legal fees, as stipulated in Section 5.

As a result of this breach, Client requests the immediate reinstatement of the original payment terms outlined in Section 3.1, with a revised payment schedule of [Proposed Payment Schedule].  In the event that Bank fails to comply with this request within [Number] days (e.g., 14 days), Client reserves the right to seek damages for breach of contract, including but not limited to lost profits, interest, and attorney’s fees.  Furthermore, Client intends to immediately terminate the agreement, effective upon full reimbursement of the outstanding balance, despite the initial agreement’s stipulations for continued service.  The effective date of termination is [Date].  We believe this resolution will best protect the Client’s interests.

Respectfully submitted,

[Name of Bank Representative]
[Title of Bank Representative]
[Bank Letterhead]
