**MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF TRIAL AND TO FORWARD THE CASE FOR NEGOTIATION**

**To the Honorable Court/Judge [Name of Court/Judge],**

This Motion for Suspension of Trial is filed by Manufacturing International (hereinafter “Manufacturing”) to seek a temporary hold on the proceedings concerning the negotiation of the Master Services Agreement (hereinafter “Agreement”) between Manufacturing and its Master Services Provider, [Client Name/Company Name] (hereinafter “Client”).  Manufacturing has recently initiated internal discussions regarding the terms of the Agreement and, due to a significant and ongoing dispute concerning the scope of services outlined in the Agreement, believes that a settlement cannot be reached expeditiously or with the required fairness.  Specifically, the Client has raised concerns regarding the ambiguity of the agreed-upon deliverables and the potential for future revisions that could significantly impact Manufacturing’s operational costs and timelines. We are seeking this suspension to allow for a more thorough and candid discussion with the Client, followed by a formalized agreement establishing clear boundaries and expectations.  The core of this motion is predicated on the Client’s demonstrated lack of willingness to engage in good-faith negotiation and the potential for further complications arising from unresolved disagreements.

The current impasse stems from discrepancies identified in the Agreement’s initial draft concerning the detailed metrics and reporting requirements for the Master Services Provider’s performance. Manufacturing has made multiple requests for clarification on these metrics, and the Client’s resistance to addressing these concerns has created a significant risk of future litigation and disruption to Manufacturing’s production schedule.  Furthermore, Manufacturing possesses compelling evidence – including internal communications and preliminary audit findings – indicating that the Client’s proposed service level agreements (SLAs) are demonstrably unattainable and will necessitate costly and protracted remediation efforts.  This situation demands immediate stabilization to avoid escalating costs and potential irreparable harm to both parties’ respective interests. We are requesting a temporary hold on the trial until a resolution can be achieved through direct negotiation.

Therefore, Manufacturing respectfully requests that this Court/Judge grant this Motion for Suspension of Trial.  We believe that a brief pause in the litigation will allow for a productive and amicable resolution of the outstanding disagreements.  We are prepared to present our final arguments and evidence at a later date, pending a successful negotiation with the Client. We are confident that through a focused and open dialogue, a mutually agreeable agreement can be reached that minimizes the risk of protracted legal battles and ensures a smooth transition to a functioning Master Services Agreement. We appreciate the Court’s consideration of this crucial matter.

Respectfully submitted,
