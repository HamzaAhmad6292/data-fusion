**MOTION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION – REAL ESTATE SOLUTIONS INC. – MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT**

To the Honorable Judge [Judge’s Name] of the [Court Name],

This Motion is submitted by Real Estate Solutions Inc. (hereinafter “RS Inc.”) on behalf of its clients, [Client Name(s)] hereinafter referred to as “Client(s).”  We respectfully request the Court’s consideration of a dispute arising from the Master Services Agreement (hereinafter “MSA”) recently negotiated between RS Inc. and [Client Name/Company Name] for the provision of [Specific Services, e.g., property marketing, property management, tenant screening].  Specifically, Client(s) are contending that the MSA, particularly regarding the scope of services outlined for [Specific Task/Period], constitutes an unenforceable and fundamentally flawed contract due to a misinterpretation of the initial agreement and a failure to adequately address potential future obligations.

The MSA was entered into on [Date of Agreement] and, while the underlying intention appears reasonable, the specific phrasing regarding [Specific Clause – e.g., “ongoing maintenance obligations” or “exclusive marketing rights”] exhibits ambiguities and uncertainties that render the agreement practically unenforceable.  Our client has diligently attempted to clarify these ambiguities through further negotiations with [Client Name/Company Name] but these efforts have yielded no resolution, and the MSA remains a point of significant concern.  We believe that the current interpretation significantly disadvantages RS Inc. and creates a substantial risk of future disputes regarding the implementation of the agreed-upon services.

Therefore, Client(s) respectfully request that the Court exercise its discretion to grant this Motion for Dispute Resolution.  We are seeking a [Specify Relief – e.g., “declaration of invalidity of the MSA” or “modification of the MSA to reflect the original intent”].  We believe that the Court’s intervention will minimize potential litigation and ensure a fair and equitable resolution of the dispute, preserving the business relationship between RS Inc. and [Client Name/Company Name] as much as possible.  We are prepared to present further evidence supporting this claim and will diligently pursue this matter in a manner that minimizes the need for costly litigation.

Respectfully submitted,
