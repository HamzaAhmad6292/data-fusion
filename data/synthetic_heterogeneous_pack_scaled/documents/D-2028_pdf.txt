**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**

*   **Jurisdiction:**  Clearly state the jurisdiction governing the agreement (e.g., State of [State]).
*   **Specifics:** Fill in the bracketed information with the precise details of the dispute.
*   **Legal Review:** This is a starting point.  **Crucially, have this drafted and reviewed by an employment law attorney in the relevant jurisdiction.**  Employment law varies considerably.
*   **Entire Agreement Clause:** A robust "entire agreement" clause is essential to prevent disputes over the scope of the agreement itself.

To help me refine this further and provide more tailored content, could you tell me:

*   What is the primary focus of the dispute? (e.g., termination, unfair treatment, etc.)
*   Are there any specific clauses you’d like to include (e.g., confidentiality, dispute resolution)?
