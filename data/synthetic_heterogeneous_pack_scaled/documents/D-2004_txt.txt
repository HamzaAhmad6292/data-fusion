**MOTION FOR REGULATORY INQUIRY – Construction Systems**

**To the Honorable [Court/Regulatory Body Name],**

This Motion is submitted by Construction Systems, LLC, on behalf of its client, [Client Name], regarding the potential compliance of [Specific Regulation/Action] with applicable state and federal regulations. Construction Systems has received notification from the [Regulatory Agency Name] pertaining to [Specifically describe the regulatory inquiry – e.g., a recent inspection, a proposed variance, a suspected violation].  The core concern centers on [Clearly state the specific issue the inquiry is raising – e.g., alleged failure to adhere to building codes, potential for environmental impact, inadequate stormwater management].  We believe this matter warrants a thorough investigation by the [Regulatory Agency Name] to ensure Construction Systems maintains a level of safety and compliance with all relevant laws and standards.  The current situation presents a demonstrable risk to public safety and the environment, potentially impacting the integrity of future construction projects within [Jurisdiction].

Specifically, the [Regulatory Agency Name]'s inquiry alleges that [Provide a concise and factual explanation of the alleged violation - e.g., the proposed change to the landscaping design violates the local stormwater management ordinance, the inspection revealed substandard concrete placement, the existing fencing does not meet required height specifications]. This discrepancy directly conflicts with [Cite specific relevant regulations or standards – e.g., the State Building Code Section 10.12, EPA guidelines for stormwater management].  Construction Systems has implemented [Briefly describe steps taken to address the issue – e.g., revised the landscaping design, initiated remedial action for the concrete placement, installed additional fencing] to mitigate these concerns. We are committed to cooperating fully with the regulatory inquiry and are confident that through the investigation, corrective actions will be implemented promptly and effectively.

Therefore, Construction Systems respectfully requests that the [Regulatory Agency Name] initiate a comprehensive investigation into this matter. We believe a thorough review of the relevant regulations and our compliance history will provide clarity and allow for timely resolution of this issue.  We further request that the regulatory agency provide us with a timeline for completion of the investigation and a detailed report outlining their findings.  Failure to address this matter promptly could result in further penalties, legal action, and, ultimately, a significant detriment to the reputation and operations of Construction Systems.  We are available to discuss this matter further and provide any additional information required.

Respectfully submitted,
