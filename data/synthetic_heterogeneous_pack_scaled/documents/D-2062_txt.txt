**MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF TRIAL – Banking Holdings Corp. v. ACME Corp**

To the Honorable Judge [Judge’s Name],

This Motion for Suspension of Trial is hereby filed by Banking Holdings Corp. (hereinafter “Banking Holdings”) in support of a hearing scheduled for [Date] in the matter of *Banking Holdings Corp. v. ACME Corp*, concerning a dispute arising from alleged discriminatory practices within ACME Corp’s employee relations department. Specifically, Banking Holdings alleges that ACME Corp has engaged in a pattern of micro-aggressions and subtle, yet pervasive, exclusion of Banking Holdings employees from key decision-making processes and opportunities within the company, thereby hindering their advancement and contributing to a hostile work environment. This dispute centers around alleged violations of Banking Holdings’ documented employee handbook policies regarding equitable opportunity and promotion, and we believe the evidence gathered thus far demonstrates a demonstrable pattern of inequitable treatment.

Our client, Banking Holdings, has meticulously documented the alleged incidents through internal investigation reports, emails, and witness statements. These documents reveal a consistent pattern of preferential treatment given to ACME Corp’s leadership team in favor of individuals with similar backgrounds and qualifications – a stark contrast to the stated promotion criteria outlined within Banking Holdings’ internal HR policies. We are seeking a temporary suspension of the trial schedule to allow for a thorough and impartial investigation of these allegations, including a comprehensive review of ACME Corp’s HR practices and a collection of additional evidence to substantiate our claims of discriminatory behavior. We are confident that a robust and unbiased investigation will ultimately reveal a lack of genuine opportunity for Banking Holdings employees to advance within ACME Corp.

Therefore, we respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion for Suspension of Trial, allowing the trial to be postponed until a full and impartial investigation can be completed.  We understand the importance of maintaining court proceedings and anticipate that this temporary pause will facilitate the accurate and impartial resolution of this matter, ensuring a fair and just outcome for our client and upholding the principles of due process. We are prepared to provide further information and evidence as necessary to support this request.  Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
