**MOTION FOR STAY OF AGREEMENT – Finance Holdings Corp. v. Alpha Solutions, Inc.**

**To the Honorable [Court Name]**

**Introduction:** This Motion for Stay is hereby submitted by Finance Holdings Corp. (hereinafter “Finance”) in support of a request to temporarily halt the execution of the Master Services Agreement (hereinafter “the Agreement”) between Finance and Alpha Solutions, Inc. (hereinafter “Alpha”) regarding the provision of specialized financial reporting services.  The request is predicated on concerns regarding the potential for unforeseen and materially adverse changes to the Agreement’s core terms and conditions, specifically concerning the scope of services, pricing, and termination provisions, which significantly impact Finance’s strategic objectives and financial stability.  We believe a temporary pause is necessary to allow for a thorough review of the Agreement’s provisions by counsel and a comprehensive risk assessment.

**Background:**  Finance and Alpha have been engaged in negotiations for a Master Services Agreement, outlining a defined framework for the ongoing provision of financial reporting services.  As of today, preliminary discussions have revealed, at a cursory level, potential discrepancies in the agreed-upon service levels and associated compensation, particularly concerning the evolving requirements for data security and audit trail maintenance.  Specifically, Finance has identified a risk that Alpha’s proposed revisions could significantly diminish the value of the Agreement, potentially leading to financial losses and disruption to existing operations. We have also received communication from Alpha suggesting that certain aspects of the Agreement are fundamentally incompatible with Finance’s long-term strategic goals for maintaining a robust and compliant financial reporting infrastructure.

**Requested Relief:**  Therefore, Finance respectfully requests that the Court grant a temporary restraining order, specifically instructing the [Relevant Court/Tribunal] to stay the execution of the Agreement until a comprehensive review and amendment process can be completed. This review should include a detailed analysis of the potential risks identified, a re-evaluation of the Agreement’s provisions, and a preliminary assessment of the potential impact on Finance’s business.  We further request that the Court’s ruling be directed to Alpha Solutions to promptly cease any further modifications to the Agreement until a legally sufficient review is completed and a revised agreement is drafted. We are prepared to provide Alpha with a detailed explanation of the concerns outlined above and to cooperate fully with this review process.

**Conclusion:** We firmly believe that a temporary pause is a prudent measure to safeguard Finance’s interests and mitigate potential risks associated with the ongoing negotiations. We are confident that a careful and measured approach will result in a more favorable and sustainable agreement for all parties involved.

Respectfully submitted,
