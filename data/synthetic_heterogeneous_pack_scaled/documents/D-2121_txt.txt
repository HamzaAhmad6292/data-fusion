**Subject: Formal Notification of Breach of Contract – Agreement dated [Date of Contract]**

Dear Mr. Smith,

This correspondence serves as formal notification that Finance Holdings Corp (“Finance” or “Company”) is initiating legal action against Finance Holdings Corp in response to a material breach of the contract dated [Date of Contract] for the provision of specialized financial analysis services. Specifically, Finance is in breach of section 7, paragraph B, of this agreement, which stipulates the timely and accurate delivery of comprehensive reports, as defined by the agreed-upon frequency and level of detail.  We have documented evidence demonstrating that the reported deliverables have been consistently delayed, with a demonstrable delay of approximately [Number] weeks, and significantly impacting our operational efficiency.

Our initial investigation has confirmed that Finance’s failure to fulfill these obligations constitutes a breach of the contract's core provisions. We have previously attempted to resolve this issue through direct communication and a request for clarification regarding the anticipated delivery timelines, but these efforts have been unsuccessful in achieving a satisfactory resolution.  We are requesting immediate and full return of the outstanding payments, totaling [Amount], previously rendered as part of the agreed-upon payment schedule.  Further, we are demanding a written explanation for the prolonged delay and propose a revised, verifiable timeline for completion of the remaining deliverables.

We intend to pursue all available legal remedies, including, but not limited to, seeking damages for breach of contract, lost profits, and potential injunctive relief, to ensure full compensation for the financial losses incurred due to this breach. We believe a prompt and amicable resolution to this matter is in the best interest of all parties involved and are prepared to explore options for a legally binding settlement.  We request a response to this notification within [Number] days outlining your position and intentions to address these concerns.  Please contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address] to schedule a meeting.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
