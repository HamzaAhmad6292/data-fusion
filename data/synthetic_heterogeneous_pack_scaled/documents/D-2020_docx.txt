**[LAWFirm Letterhead - Technology Partners]**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**To:** ACME Corp – Legal Department

**Subject: Formal Notification of Employment Dispute and Demand for Resolution**

This firm, representing Technology Partners (“Client”), is writing to formally notify you of a dispute arising from your termination of employment on October 15, 2023, effective immediately following a performance review.  The termination was entered into pursuant to a previously negotiated severance agreement dated November 5, 2022, which Client signed with our representation.  We understand that you have now initiated legal proceedings against Client, alleging violations of your employment agreement and resulting in damages.  Specifically, your claims center around the alleged breach of contract regarding the agreed-upon terms and the resulting financial loss resulting from the termination.

We have carefully reviewed the documents submitted by ACME Corp, including your initial demand for settlement and the subsequent formal complaint filed with the relevant labor board. While we acknowledge the validity of your position, we believe that a protracted and adversarial approach to resolving this matter will be detrimental to Client’s interests. Our legal strategy centers on demonstrating a reasonable interpretation of the severance agreement and establishing a solid case based on demonstrable damages suffered as a result of ACME Corp’s actions. We are prepared to vigorously defend our client’s rights, including demanding a full and fair accounting of any costs incurred and seeking appropriate compensation for the diminished earning potential experienced during the termination period.

Therefore, we formally request that you immediately cease all further legal actions and engage in good-faith negotiations with Client to establish a mutually agreeable resolution. Specifically, we propose a meeting within [Number] days from the date of this letter, wherein we can discuss the outstanding claims and explore potential solutions. We are open to mediation to facilitate a constructive and cost-effective outcome.  We anticipate a resolution which will safeguard Client’s reputation and ensure compliance with all applicable employment laws.  Please contact our office at [Phone Number] or [Email Address] to schedule this meeting.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm Name]

[Your Title]
