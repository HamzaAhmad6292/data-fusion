**[Date]**

**To:** Mr. Robert Miller, CEO, Energy International
**From:** [Your Law Firm Name] – [Your Contact Name]
**Subject:** Formal Notice of Contract Breach – Agreement dated [Date of Agreement]

Dear Mr. Miller,

This correspondence serves as a formal notification regarding a breach of contract between Energy International and Energy International, Inc. (“Energy”) as outlined in the Agreement dated [Date of Agreement], specifically concerning provision [Specify specific provision – e.g., "Section 3, Clause 2 regarding delivery schedules"]. We have identified that Energy has failed to consistently meet the agreed-upon delivery schedules outlined in this agreement, resulting in demonstrable delays impacting our operational continuity.  Specifically, the agreed-upon delivery date of [Specific Delivery Date] has not been met, and we have documented [Briefly explain the impact – e.g., "a delay in the implementation of Project X, costing us approximately $X"].  We have previously attempted to resolve this issue through [Briefly mention previous attempts – e.g., “scheduled meetings and email correspondence”] but have not achieved a satisfactory resolution.

Our legal counsel has advised us that a breach of contract, as evidenced by this failure to meet contractual obligations, necessitates immediate action.  We demand that Energy International immediately rectify the situation by adhering to the agreed-upon delivery schedule outlined in the original Agreement.  Specifically, we require a revised delivery timeline of [Proposed Revised Delivery Date] within [Number] days of the date of this letter. Failure to comply with this deadline will leave us with no alternative but to pursue legal remedies, including seeking injunctive relief to halt further delivery and, if necessary, legal action to recover damages incurred due to this breach.

We are open to discussing a reasonable settlement to avoid further escalation.  We propose a payment of [Amount] to compensate for the costs incurred as a direct result of this breach, along with a commitment from Energy to implement corrective measures to prevent future delays.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further and explore a mutually agreeable solution. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to schedule a meeting to discuss this further.

Sincerely,

[Your Law Firm Name]
