Dear Mr. Miller,

This correspondence serves as a formal introductory communication regarding the ongoing negotiation for a Master Services Agreement (MSA) between Manufacturing Group LLC (hereinafter referred to as “Manufacturing Group”) and [Client Name/Company Name] (hereinafter referred to as “Client”).

We are currently at the initial phase of drafting the MSA and anticipate a comprehensive agreement will require approximately [State Timeframe - e.g., 4-6 weeks] of collaborative effort.  Our initial understanding is that the MSA will cover key areas including scope of services, pricing, liability, intellectual property rights, termination provisions, and governing law.

Our initial assessment of the Client’s needs and expectations suggests a strong desire for a MSA that clearly defines the responsibilities and expectations for both parties.  We are committed to ensuring this agreement accurately reflects the mutual benefit and long-term viability of the relationship.  We have outlined our initial thoughts and preliminary proposal, which will be formally presented to you for review and feedback by [Date – e.g., October 27, 2023].  Specifically, we anticipate addressing a clause regarding ongoing maintenance and support activities, which we believe requires careful consideration to protect both parties' interests.

We are maintaining open communication and actively participating in discussions about potential adjustments to the draft MSA to ensure alignment with the Client’s objectives. We propose scheduling a meeting in the coming week to discuss these initial aspects further and explore the possibility of a facilitated negotiation process. Please let us know your availability for a meeting at your earliest convenience.  We are confident that a mutually agreeable MSA will be forged.  Sincerely,

[Your Name/Law Firm Name]
